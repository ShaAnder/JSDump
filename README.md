## Welcome to the JS D U M P

Main Javascript linker repo. Allows the user to navigate to the various projects I have created. Check below for quick navigation.

**Jump to:**  [Ideas](#ideas) | [Course Projects](#course-projects) | [Applications](#applications) | [Snippets](#snippets)

## Ideas

This is the ideas section, these are all projects or ideas I have started, but not strictly finished yet. I tend to try and finish whatever I start working on but it isn't always the case. If anything is not currently being worked on / is abandoned it will be marked as such in the repo shown.

## Applications

Much like the finished course projects section, these are finished and working applications that I wanted to find a place for that 
are not nessecarily on my portfolio, older portfolio works are stored here too!

## Snippets

Finally we have the snippets section, this is where i keep all my single file code snippets i've worked on, I really like making small
things that I can just reuse in other projects or a toolbox rather, and while some of these are stuff i use frequently, this is not 
all of them. I need some secrets after all ðŸ˜‰
